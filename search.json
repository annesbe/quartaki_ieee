Creating reports is a time-consuming task, as it often requires switching between programs for writing, doing analyses and creating tables and figures, as well as other graphical and textual programs. Learning efficient tools in combining programming and report generation are becoming increasingly important to alleviate the manual and burdensome process of switching programs. Quarto is a second generation report framework based on the popular markdown plain text format. Combining writing in markdown with the ability to run code to format, analyse, and visualise data, all in the same place, creates a seamless environment for the researchers to produce reports. While this workshop will focus on using Quarto with R, it also has native abilities to interact with python, observable.js and Julia, without needing R installed. This makes Quarto a great tool to learn, no matter which language you focus on."

We can choose to have the code shown or hidden, or provide the reader with the option to see the code if they wish.\nMy favourite foods:\nWe can also reference the figures Figure 1 and Figure 2\nCode\nggplot(penguins,\n       aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n           y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = species)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", \n              color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Penguin bill length and depth ratio by species\nAnd the order of the figures does not really matter. If you change the order to the figures, but keep their labels, no references will be broken in the report. We can also incorporate text derived from data to look as if it were “normal” text. Like the number of rows in the data being 344, and the number of female penguins being 165. We can also add footnotes1, and they will keep themselves numbered and placed correctly2\nCode\npenguins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,\n             fill = species)) + \n  geom_density() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Penguin density\nA summary of the observed penguin data can be found in Table 1. For this cross-reference to work, we need to have the tbl- prefix in the label name of the chunk that creates the table. The number of the table will update if another table appears before it, meaning you no longer need to deal with number your content correctly.\nCode\npenguins |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(contains(\"_\"),\n               values_drop_na = TRUE) |&gt; \n  group_by(name, species) |&gt; \n  summarise(across(value, \n                   list(Mean = mean, \n                        SD = sd,\n                        Min = min,\n                        Max = max,\n                        N = length),\n                   .names = \"{.fn}\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    name = str_replace_all(name, \"_\", \" \")\n  ) |&gt; \n  kable(booktabs = TRUE, digits = 3,) |&gt; \n  kable_classic() |&gt; \n  add_header_above(c(\" \" = 4, \"Range\" = 2, \" \" = 1)) |&gt; \n  collapse_rows(1)\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Penguin summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\n\n\nname\nspecies\nMean\nSD\nMin\nMax\nN\n\n\n\n\nbill depth mm\nAdelie\n18.346\n1.217\n15.5\n21.5\n151\n\n\nbill depth mm\nChinstrap\n18.421\n1.135\n16.4\n20.8\n68\n\n\nbill depth mm\nGentoo\n14.982\n0.981\n13.1\n17.3\n123\n\n\nbill length mm\nAdelie\n38.791\n2.663\n32.1\n46.0\n151\n\n\nbill length mm\nChinstrap\n48.834\n3.339\n40.9\n58.0\n68\n\n\nbill length mm\nGentoo\n47.505\n3.082\n40.9\n59.6\n123\n\n\nbody mass g\nAdelie\n3700.662\n458.566\n2850.0\n4775.0\n151\n\n\nbody mass g\nChinstrap\n3733.088\n384.335\n2700.0\n4800.0\n68\n\n\nbody mass g\nGentoo\n5076.016\n504.116\n3950.0\n6300.0\n123\n\n\nflipper length mm\nAdelie\n189.954\n6.539\n172.0\n210.0\n151\n\n\nflipper length mm\nChinstrap\n195.824\n7.132\n178.0\n212.0\n68\n\n\nflipper length mm\nGentoo\n217.187\n6.485\n203.0\n231.0\n123"
